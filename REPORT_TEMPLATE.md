## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of analyzing high-quality GIS TIFF images using AI/ML techniques for land cover classification. The project focused on developing an automated pipeline for feature extraction and classification of satellite imagery into distinct land cover categories.

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

### 1.1 Background
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies generate vast amounts of high-resolution imagery that requires automated analysis for efficient land cover mapping. Traditional manual interpretation methods are time-consuming and subjective, making machine learning approaches essential for large-scale applications.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop an automated pipeline for TIFF image preprocessing
- Implement feature extraction methods for land cover classification  
- Build and evaluate ML/DL models for semantic segmentation
- Generate accurate land cover maps with proper visualization
- Assess model performance using standard evaluation metrics

### 1.3 Scope
This analysis focuses on [specify scope - e.g., "urban area classification" or "multispectral satellite imagery analysis"] using unsupervised learning approaches due to the absence of ground truth labels.

## 2. Methodology

**Assumptions:**
- Images contain standard RGB or multispectral bands

### 2.2 Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline consisted of the following steps:

1. **Image Loading and Validation**

   - Metadata extraction (CRS, transform, dimensions)
   - Data quality validation and integrity checks

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing data identification and interpolation
   - Noise reduction using Gaussian filtering
   - Outlier detection and handling

3. **Normalization**
   - Min-max scaling to [0,1] range
   - Per-band normalization to account for spectral differences
   - Histogram equalization for contrast enhancement

4. **Geometric Processing**
   - Resampling to target resolution (512Ã—512 pixels)
   - Coordinate system verification
   - Spatial alignment validation
